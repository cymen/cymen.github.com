Doug reviewed [my console-based tic-tac-toe solution in ruby](https://github.com/cymen/ttt-ruby). We discussed some of the areas that I had problems testing and some ruby patterns that could make some of my work more elegant. The next challenge is to make the project work with both a console and HTTP interface.
