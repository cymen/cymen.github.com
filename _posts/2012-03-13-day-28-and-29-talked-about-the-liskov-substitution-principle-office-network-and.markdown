On February 1st, 2012, I started a [Software Craftsman apprenticeship](http://www.8thlight.com/apprenticeship) with 8th Light under [Doug Bradbury](http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/doug-bradbury) in order to study the agile approach to software development. This post is one of a series about my experience at 8th light as an apprentice.



**Monday**

I tried explaining the Liskov substitution principle to my fellow apprentices. It was a bit tricky to explain particularly as Robert Martin's example in [PPP](http://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445/) and the definition are tied to static type systems. However it is still an important principle in a dynamic language and one can see that in the expectation of behavior that PPP reiterates throughout the chapter on the topic.

**Tuesday**

I helped Doug with some office improvements by configuring two new Cisco wireless access points. I met with some other apprentices and Paul to kick off an internal project that should be interesting.
