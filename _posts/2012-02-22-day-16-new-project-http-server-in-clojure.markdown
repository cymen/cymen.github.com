On February 1st, 2012, I started a [Software Craftsman apprenticeship](http://www.8thlight.com/apprenticeship) with 8th Light under [Doug Bradbury](http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/doug-bradbury) in order to study the agile approach to software development. This post is one of a series about my experience at 8th light as an apprentice.


My next project is an HTTP server in clojure. I can use sockets. A quick search revealed [clojure-contrib](http://richhickey.github.com/clojure-contrib/index.html) that has [server-socket](http://richhickey.github.com/clojure-contrib/server-socket-api.html). The project needs to pass the [cob_spec web server test suite](https://github.com/8thlight/cob_spec) from 8th Light. The test suite is built on top of [FitNesse](http://fitnesse.org/) which is another project from 8th Light: a sort of mashup of wiki, requirements and testing.

While mulling this over I'm continuing to work on the Clojure Koans and attempting to do a Kata. I asked Doug and he said it's normal to feel really weird trying to do a Kata but you basically just need to do it just like brushing your teeth.
