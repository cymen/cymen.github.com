The RaspberryPi has a lot going for it but you can get started with a small ARM computer without the hassle of ordering from one or two venders and waiting for a bare board computer that also needs a power supply, case, memory storage, USB cable, HDMI cable, ethernet cable, etc. One alternative is a Pogo Plug. In the USA, you can order one for $20-40 from a number of sellers. It comes with a case, multiple USB ports, and a built-in power supply. You will need an ethernet cable but otherwise you're all set. The one thing you can't do with it easily compared to a RaspberryPi is hook it up to a display. But if you wanted a small Linux-based computer that sips electricity and is ready to go hardware-wise out of the box it fits the bill.

The software on the Pogo Plug can be easily changed to an ARM build of Arch Linux with specific instructions at [archlinuxarm.org](http://archlinuxarm.org/). After the install, I was able to hook up an external drive and setup bittorrent and other applications that are nice to have running all the time but don't need a lot of computing resources. It is a shame leaving a full desktop powered on using 60-100 watts but a small ARM device like this uses something close to 10-15 watts.
