On February 1st, 2012, I started a [Software Craftsman apprenticeship](http://www.8thlight.com/apprenticeship) with 8th Light under [Doug Bradbury](http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/doug-bradbury) in order to study the agile approach to software development. This post is one of a series about my experience at 8th light as an apprentice.


Today I'm a bit off! I got in a bit later than planned and fumbled the morning greeting. I think everyone is supposed to say hi to each other. I like that. But I felt shy and wasn't sure if I should interrupt and say hi. Tomorrow I'll get it right!

I'm continuing to work on the ruby koans. Right now, I'm at 159/280 after just finishing figuring out how to raise the exceptions in triangle.rb when the triangle lengths are invalid. I ended up going to the [stackoverflow link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3834203/ruby-koan-151-raising-exceptions) mentioned in about_triangle_project_2.rb. This is going a bit slower than I expected however I definitely see the value as I'll be coming back to this when I hit the corner cases in ruby and can't remember the correct behavior.
