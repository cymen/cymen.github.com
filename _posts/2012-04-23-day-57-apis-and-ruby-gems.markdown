On February 1st, 2012, I started a [Software Craftsman apprenticeship](http://www.8thlight.com/apprenticeship) with 8th Light under [Doug Bradbury](http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/doug-bradbury) in order to study the agile approach to software development. This post is one of [a series about my experience at 8th light as an apprentice](http://blog.cymen.org/category/8th-light/apprentice/).



I spent the day expanding the API on an internal tool in order to support additional functionality that is required for another internal tool. This was interesting because the API is wrapped by a Ruby gem created with Jeweler. Ruby gems are small packages of code that have version numbers. Ruby on Rails is itself a gem and the typical Rails project relies on additional gems. I'd never created a gem before so it was an interesting experience.
