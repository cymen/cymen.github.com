Today I received my challenges from Doug. As mentioned earlier, I cannot discuss what they are so this blog is likely going to go silent for a couple weeks.

I rode my bike in again today and it was fun if slightly sweaty. I have to remember to take it easy as I get closer to the office. Unfortunately, on the way home I had a flat rear tire. I was carrying everything except a pump as the small one I'd purchased didn't work. I walked to a bike shop, brought a pump and patched the tire out front with my kit. This worked out fine although I can now appreciate why some have more than a passing interest in small pumps.
