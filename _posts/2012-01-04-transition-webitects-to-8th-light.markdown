I'm starting an [8th Light fellowship](http://www.8thlight.com/apprenticeship) with [Doug Bradbury](http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/doug-bradbury) on February 1st, 2012! I am very excited to learn more about test driven development, software design and agile methodology by practice as an apprentice.

I am going to miss the team at Webitects. For the past two years, I've worked on a number of interesting and challenging projects. It has been a really good experience and I will definitely stay in touch.
