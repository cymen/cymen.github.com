On February 1st, 2012, I started a [Software Craftsman apprenticeship](http://www.8thlight.com/apprenticeship) with 8th Light under [Doug Bradbury](http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/doug-bradbury) in order to study the agile approach to software development. This post is one of a series about my experience at 8th light as an apprentice.


Today I attacked minimax and slowly figured out how to use it. I'm almost there -- I'm able to iterate over all the possible tic-tac-toe boards but I'm not weighting the moves appropriately in the case of blocking the opponent. The wikipedia article is pretty clear though so hopefully I can finish it this evening after a break.
