Today I attacked minimax and slowly figured out how to use it. I'm almost there -- I'm able to iterate over all the possible tic-tac-toe boards but I'm not weighting the moves appropriately in the case of blocking the opponent. The wikipedia article is pretty clear though so hopefully I can finish it this evening after a break.
