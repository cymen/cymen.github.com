Today at 8LU [Jeff Cohen from Code Academy](http://codeacademy.org/staff) presented "Beginner-focused Learning" which was both interesting and useful. Part of working at 8th Light is teaching others no matter what you're position is so it was very relevant.

Doug had some more audio-visual work for me as we need to put in a new VGA run to the projector and Doug redid the audio in the room. We also relocated the video camera that is used to share 8LU with those at remote sites. The changes seemed to work well.
