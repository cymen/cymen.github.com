On February 1st, 2012, I started a [Software Craftsman apprenticeship](http://www.8thlight.com/apprenticeship) with 8th Light under [Doug Bradbury](http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/doug-bradbury) in order to study the agile approach to software development. This post is one of a series about my experience at 8th light as an apprentice.


I spent the morning bashing my head against Negamax trying to figure out why my approach wasn't working. In the afternoon, I decided to go forward from what I knew was working with my test cases so far instead of trying to make a huge leap (my huge leap was running it on an empty board which was returning 0 for all spaces).

The pay off was that I was able to resolve a sign bug in my implementation by writing another "small step" test and then fixing the bug that prevented it from working.
