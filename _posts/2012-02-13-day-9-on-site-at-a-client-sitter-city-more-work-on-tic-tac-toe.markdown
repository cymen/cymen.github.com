I met Doug this morning at an 8th Light client site. I observed the SCRUM stand up of the team working with Doug and some subsequent meetings. It was interesting to hear some of the philosophical approaches that 8th Light encourages. I believe some of them were discussed by Uncle Bob on the 8th Light blog titled [Clean Architecture](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2011/11/22/Clean-Architecture.html).

Doug and I went over my tic-tac-toe progress and he pointed me to a post by Josh on cleanly testing input/output in Ruby on the 8th Light blog: [Testing Code That's hard to test](http://blog.8thlight.com/josh-cheek/2011/10/01/testing-code-thats-hard-to-test.html). I am reading that and will then work on fancying up and cleanly implementing the console portion of my tic-tac-toe game. It is going to be tricky not to violate the single responsibility principle.
