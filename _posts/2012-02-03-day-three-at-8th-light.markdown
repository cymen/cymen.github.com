On February 1st, 2012, I started a [Software Craftsman apprenticeship](http://www.8thlight.com/apprenticeship) with 8th Light under [Doug Bradbury](http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/doug-bradbury) in order to study the agile approach to software development. This post is one of a series about my experience at 8th light as an apprentice.


I completed the koans yesterday however I wasn't happy with a few solutions. I reviewed one of these with Doug and we tried to come up with a cleaner solution however it didn't really seem possible. Or at least nothing cleaner came from either of our minds. This is normally where I move on and let the subconscious take a crack at it.

The next assignment is to work on a ruby implementation of tic tac toe that is:



	
  * fully tested

	
  * uses classes that follow the [single responsibility principle (SRP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)

	
  * can be played on the console

	
  * can choose who goes first (computer or human)

	
  * uses MiniMax algorithm for the computer player
