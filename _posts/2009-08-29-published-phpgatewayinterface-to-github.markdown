I wrote a hopefully generic class in PHP to proxy CGI scripts. The idea being that sometimes one wants to get the output of a CGI script and do various things with it before displaying it. In my particular case, wrap CVSWeb so the output can be put into a HTML DIV.

The code is [published on github as PHPGatewayInterface](http://github.com/cymen/PHPGatewayInterface/tree/master).
