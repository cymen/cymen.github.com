I completed my apprenticeship challenges on July 6th, 2012. To recap, I began an apprenticeship in Software Craftsmanship at 8th Light with Doug Bradbury as my mentor on February 1st, 2012. I came to 8th Light because I suspected test-driven development was the right way to go. At the time, there were three main reasons I wanted to make a change: improving the quality of my work by reducing bugs, improving the accuracy of my estimates and the approach to meeting the estimates and improving the approach to long term maintenance. These concerns came out of other projects I worked on and I hoped that TDD would help me with my goals.

I am happy to say 5 months later that I do indeed think TDD will help. I accepted a position with 8th Light as a Software Craftsman on Monday. I look forward to continuing to work toward my goals and am very curious about the other methods in use at 8th Light.

I would like to thank Doug, Paul, Micah and the rest of 8th Light for their commitment to software craftsmanship. If you are reading this and are curious about 8th Light or any of these topics, I encourage you to stop by on a Friday at noon (check university.8thlight.com to confirm there is a scheduled event and RSVP so we have enough food). You can talk to employees and other people involved in the industry, grab some food and hear a presentation and spend the afternoon pairing on open source projects or on a topic you'd like to work on.
