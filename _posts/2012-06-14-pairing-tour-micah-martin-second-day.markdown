[Micah](http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/micah-martin) and I paired for a second day focusing on the project we'd worked on the day before: a Clojure program that loads data sets, processes them into one or moere data structures and then runs algorithms on these data structures. That all sounds a bit mysterious but I don't know how much detail I can go into. I was curious on the train ride out to Libertyville if we'd get to a fulfilling point at the end of the day. We did via tests. Micah is likely going to try it on data this evening and I'm curious to know how it works out (just because the tests are passing doesn't mean the job is finished: the performance of the algorithm is critical).
